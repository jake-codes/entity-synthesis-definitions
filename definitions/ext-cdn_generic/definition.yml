# This file creates new CDN entities based upon SyntheticRequest URL's 
#     that contain the string 'cdn'. Please see the instructions in the
#     following script to generate the events to create these entities:
#     https://github.com/jake-codes/CDN_EntitySynthesis

domain: EXT
# [mandatory] The type of an entity. Must be unique within its domain, but may be duplicated between domains.
# Please add a brief description of what your type is here on the definition file.
type: GENERIC_CDN

# Entity definitions without this section are synthesized based on rules defined elsewhere.
synthesis:
  # [mandatory] The name of a telemetry attribute that will be used as the id of the entity, so it needs to be unique,
  # it can be the same field used for the name or not.
  identifier: cdn_url

  # [mandatory] The name of a telemetry attribute that will be used as the name of the entity (i.e. k8s.cluster.name).
  name: cdn_url

  # Set to true if the identifier is expected to be longer than our maximum allowed characters (see README guidelines), defaults to false
  encodeIdentifierInGUID: true

  # [mandatory] Condition that must be met for this entity to be synthesized.
  # Please refer to the documentation to see the different types of conditions supported.
  conditions:
    # The attributeâ€™s value must match the provided value
    - attribute: eventType
      value: "CDN"


  # Telemetry attributes that should be extracted into entity tags.
  tags:
    cdn_url:
      multiValue: false
    domain:
      multiValue: false
    host:
      multiValue: false
    monitorName:
      multiValue: false
    
    
# Template that can be used to generate a dashboard for the entity.
# If your telemetry comes from different providers you can specify a dashboard for each one of them, otherwise you can just use `newRelic`
dashboardTemplates:
  newRelic:
    template: dashboard.json

# Reference to the golden and/or summary metrics associated with the entity (if any).
compositeMetrics:
  goldenMetrics:
    - golden_metrics.yml
  summaryMetrics:
    - summary_metrics.yml

# The golden tags associated with the entity. They must be existing NewRelic tags which includes:
#   - Tags extracted from telemetry attributes and defined here in the `tags` section.
#   - Tags added to the entity through other means.
# goldenTags:
#   - tagNameA
#   - tagNameB
